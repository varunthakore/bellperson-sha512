# bellperson-SHA512

This library contains circuit for SHA-512 hash function and circuit representation of u64, created using [bellperson](https://github.com/filecoin-project/bellperson) (Filecoin's fork of [bellman](https://github.com/zkcrypto/bellman)).

This project was part of the submission for [ZK MOOC Hackathon](https://zk-hacking.org/) for [zk-Circuits Track](https://zk-hacking.org/tracks/zk_circuit_track/) and it was selected as one of the winners for *Category 2: Circuits/R1CSs for recursive SNARKs*.
